title:  "Paper Review - LVars"

The papers we are interested in:

1. LVars: Lattice-based data structures for deterministic parallelism,
   FHPC'13
2. Freeze After Writing: Quasi-Deterministic Parallel Programming with
   LVars, POPL'14
3. Taming the Parallel Effect Zoo: Extensible Deterministic
   Parallelism with LVish, PLDI'14

LVars
=====

A model for deterministic-by-construction parallel programming

Allows multiple assigments to shared value given that they are
monotonically increasing (wrt a user-specified lattice).

Aside: this means that the merge operator, which merges concurrent
updates, finds LUB. It follows that merge operation is commutative,
associative and idempotent. Therefore, LVars is a model for writing
CRDTs.

Monotonic writes and "threshold reads"

While there are models that encourage deterministic parallelism, few
of them guarantee determinism for all programs written using the
model.

Verbatim - "Since pure programming with futures is a poor fit for
producer/consumer computations, one might then turn to stateful
deterministic parallel models" âˆ€
